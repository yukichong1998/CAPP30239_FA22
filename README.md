# CAPP30239 Data Visualization for Policy Analysis

## Course Details:
This repository contains my code, assignments and projects for the course CAPP 30239: Data Visualization for Public Policy (Fall 2022) at the University of Chicago taught by Professor Tiffany France. 

### Welcome to the humble abode of my soon-to-be created data visualizations!
The intersection of tech and design - being able to translate messy (and sometimes unnecessarily complicated) data into digestible (and hopefully visually appealing) insights -  has always been exciting to me. Thus being able to deep dive into not only the technical aspects of data visualization, but also the design princples behind these creations, and to apply them to my policy interests in urban health and sustainability is something I'm looking forward to this quarter. This repository shall track my baby steps of exploration and improvement throughout the quarter and hopefully also hold some decent and maybe whimsical pieces of work that I can be proud of.
