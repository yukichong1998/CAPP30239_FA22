        <h2>What exactly is telehealth?</h2>
        <p>Imagine not having to worry about the wait time, travel costs, taking time off from work or arranging for childcare to accommodate your medical appointments. Instead, you can see your doctor from the comfort of your own bed or sofa. Or even better – having the access to medical specialists that you previously chose not to visit due to the long distance. In essence, telehealth leverages digital information and various communication technologies (including audio and video conferencing) to deliver and support healthcare services remotely.</p>

      <h2>63-fold spike in Medicare fee-for-service (FFS) beneficiary telehealth visits in 2020</h2>
      <p>Since the outbreak of COVID-19, we have witnessed a dramatic spike in the uptake of telehealth services.  A new <a href="https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2021/12/03/new-hhs-study-shows-63-fold-increase-in-medicare-telehealth-utilization-during-pandemic.html">report</a> from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services reported a 63-fold increase in the number of Medicare fee-for-service (FFS) beneficiary telehealth visits in 2020, from approximately 840,000 in 2019 to nearly 52.7 million in 2020.</p>
      <p>Based on <a href="https://data.cms.gov/summary-statistics-on-use-and-payments/medicare-service-type-reports/medicare-telehealth-trends">data</a> released by the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), national telehealth usage peaked in April 2020, with over 45% of Medicare users using at least one telehealth service. While this has since stabilized to approximately 20%, telehealth utilization has nonetheless made remarkable progress from pre-covid times of a mere 7%.</p>
      <p>In addition, funding to the telehealth space is at an <a href="https://www.cbinsights.com/research/telehealth-tech-funding-trends/">all-time high</a>. Strong continued uptake, favorable regulatory environment, and strong investment into this space are all contributing to this steady rate of adoption – it sure seems like telehealth is poised to stay a robust option for care.</p>

      <p>However, is this increased usage and its benefits truly reaching all communities? CMS revealed that disparities in telehealth uptake and modality of telehealth visits exist along racial and generational lines, as well as the rural-urban divide. For instance, a lower telehealth utilization rate was reported for Black and older individuals, as compared to their White and younger counterparts.</p>

      <p>Apart from the surge in telehealth utilization rates across all races between 2019 and 2020, there seems to be noticeable differences in utilization between races, with Black individuals reporting the lowest proportion of telehealth use out of their total Medicare Part B Visits. However, the disparity is much more apparent between different age groups – specifically the older groups ages 65 and above versus their younger counterparts. By the end of Q1 2022, there were over a third of the Medicare users aged 0-64 with at least one Telehealth service, whereas for users aged 65 and above, the numbers wavered between 15-18%.</p>

      <h2>Modality Matters Too: Video Telehealth Rates Were Lowest Among Non-White Individuals and Adults Aged 65 and Older</h2>
      <p>Beyond telehealth utilization rates, disparities in access to video telehealth services are an equally significant cause for concern. Live video services offer advantages over audio-only services in many clinical contexts – For instance, it may help certain specialty practitioners to be able to observe you in your home environment and facilitate better assessment of your condition.</p>

      <p>Yet, the <a href="https://aspe.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/documents/4e1853c0b4885112b2994680a58af9ed/telehealth-hps-ib.pdf">Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation (ASPE)</a> reports that video telehealth rates were lowest among older and non-White individuals – with White individuals experiencing 61.9% of their telehealth visits using video services, compared to 53.6%, 50,7% and 51.3% for Black, Hispanic and Asian individuals respectively.</p>

    <p>Several barriers can hinder patients from engaging with their providers via telehealth effectively, or even using it altogether – many of which trace back to the underlying digital divide across different populations in the United States. </p>

      <h2>Over 17% of rural households still struggle with no broadband</h2>
      <p>Often, the lack of access to secure and reliable internet connectivity or broadband is the first hurdle patients have to overcome to engage with their providers via telehealth. While the <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/reports-research/reports/broadband-progress-reports/fourteenth-broadband-deployment-report">latest broadband deployment figures </a>released by the Federal Communications Commission are promising, reporting an overall decline in the percentage of households with no broadband to 4.4% in 2019, down from 10.1% in 2015. </p>
      <p>However, this remains a work in progress as there remains a clear rural-urban divide in the rate of broadband deployment over the past four years – with over 98% of urban communities enjoying access to broadband, approximately 17% of rural households still struggle with the lack thereof.</p>

      <h2>Today’s literacy goes beyond reading and writing</h2>
      <p>One factor contributing to this gap in telehealth utilization and experience that is relatively overlooked by policymakers is the issue of digital literacy – Having access to technology is insufficient to ensure access to telehealth, digital literacy, or the understanding of how to actually use the technology to access telehealth services, should not be understated.</p>

      <p>Looking at age, it is clear that the proportion of respondents with lower digital literacy scores increases with age – with 31% and 37% of respondents in the “45-54” and “55-65” age groups respectively reporting “Below Level 1” proficiency scores while less than 20% of their younger counterparts fall in that lowest performance range.</p>

  <h1 id="chicago">Zooming into the City of Chicago</h1>
  <p>Despite being roughly <a href="https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/chicagocityillinois">29% Black and 29% Hispanic</a>, the city of Chicago is one of the most segregated in America. This legacy of segregation is the underlying cause of the deeply rooted socio-economic disparities and opportunity gaps that exist between different racial communities in Chicago, the gulf that continues to perpetuate inequities across all spheres of life. </p> 
  <p>Unsurprisingly, inequitable access to quality healthcare is one of the longstanding issues that arose out of and at the same time, continues to reinforce racial segregation till this day. As much as the outbreak of COVID-19 amplified the importance of telehealth in maintaining healthcare service delivery when all came to a standstill, it also made clear that existing socioeconomic inequities were bound to hinder some from accessing this service when they need it most. </p>

      <h2>Compounding the Problem: Where Race Meets Internet Connectivity, Telehealth, And So Much More</h2>

      <p>For instance, a significantly higher proportion of households with no internet is largely concentrated in the west and south sides of Chicago, with over 42% and 38% of households in the Burnside and West Englewood neighborhoods struggling with a lack of internet connectivity.</p>

    <h2>The Key to Expanding Telehealth Access: Meeting Communities Where They Are</h2>
    <p>Undeniably, there is currently a dearth of data collected on community-level telehealth usage in Chicago, but the data available thus far underscores the need to study Chicago’s digital divide on a more granular level in order to implement targeted interventions for different disadvantaged communities based on their unique needs.</p>
    <p>Without addressing these critical and seemingly elements of telehealth implementation, telehealth will fall short of its promise and, rather than mitigate health inequities, perpetuate health inequities in the very communities that stand to benefit most from its implementation.</p>

    <h1 id="writeup">Project Write-Up</h1>
    <p>Personally, digital health has always been an area of interest for me as I see it as a great opportunity to reimagine how healthcare services are delivered today. Yet, existing barriers on a community level - many of which are tied to racial and socioeconomic inequities of everyday life - should not be overlooked because it is only when these challenges are acknowledged and addressed, telemedicine can truly be accessible to all.</p>
    <p>My story was very much shaped by my existing understanding of the telehealth industry and the availability of reliable data on telehealth utilization, access and equity. While I felt like I solidified my idea pretty early on and mostly stuck with it, the main bulk of my time and effort was spent on filling in small gaps in my story to strengthen the overall flow and navigating d3 to build the charts that I had in mind.</p>

    <h4>Data collection </h4>
    <p>
        In terms of data collection, my main data sources include:
        <ul>
            <li>Center for Medicare & Medicaid Services: Medicare beneficiaries’ telehealth utilization rates overall and by age</li>
            <li>Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation (ASPE): Medicare beneficiaries’ telehealth utilization rates by race and telehealth modality by race</li>
            <li>Federal Communications Commission: Broadband deployment rates</li>
            <li>Program for the International Assessment of Adult Competencies (PIAAC): Digital literacy scores</li>
            <li>UChicago Internet Equity Initiative and American Community Survey: Community-level internet connectivity and various socioeconomic indicators in Chicago</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    
    <h4>Data gaps</h4>
    <p>There were two main data gaps in my project: 
        <ol>
            <li>Firstly, it would have been ideal to be able to not only examine telehealth utilization rates of Medicare beneficiaries, but of the entire population in the United States. However, since such data would more likely be systematically collected under specific governmental or health insurance schemes, it is understandable that only Medicare data was more readily available.</li>
            <li>Second, there is a lack of data collected on telehealth utilization rates on a regional or state level, thus I did not manage to find Chicago-specific telehealth data. Since telehealth is, from a public policy perspective, a relatively nascent field, I believe the lack of data and research as of yet is unsurprising but also an area of improvement looking ahead. </li>
        </ol>
        Overall, the data gaps did not affect my narrative tremendously, though they would have provided a more comprehensive view of the national trends in telehealth utilization and greater insights into the Chicago case study respectively.
    </p>
    
    <h4>Choosing chart types</h4>
    <p>The whole process of crafting my story and visualizations involved constantly questioning what the main point I wanted to present was for each chart. Along the way, I have dropped some charts which I had initially plan to create, such as a chart that shows the growth in funding within telehealth space, as well as changed chart type to present my data more effectively - for instance, my chart on broadband deployment was initially supposed to be an area chart showing the proportion of Americans that lack broadband access relative to the national population. However, this trend over the years was not very significant so it looked almost like a rectangular block and making sense of it was challenging. Thus, I decided to change that into a multiline chart that compared rural and urban broadband deployment and highlighted how while the trend in recent years has been promising, broadband equity remains a work in progress.</p>
    
    <p>There was a diverse range of chart types used in this article, including: 
        <ul>
            <li>Sunburst chart to reflect a hierarchical relationship between different categories;</li>
            <li>Area chart to emphasize on the drastic change in telehealth utilization rates in terms of its sheer volume;</li>
            <li>Horizontal and vertical stacked and grouped bar charts were mainly used for more effective comparison across discrete categories like race/ethnicity;</li>
            <li>Multiline charts were used for comparison between categories with an emphasis on their change over time;</li>
            <li>Choropleth map of Chicago was also used to visualize the proportion of households with no internet in each neighborhood, with the color intensity of the neighborhood as a helpful reference of the proportion;</li>
            <li>Simple linear regression chart was used to reflect the correlation between internet connectivity and certain socioeconomic and demographic indicators.</li>
        </ul></p>
    
    <h4>Final thoughts</h4>
    <p>Overall, this was certainly a challenging and rewarding project both in terms of constructing a strong narrative well-supported by visualizations as well as the actual coding in HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Navigating d3 was not easy at all - while I like that it really allows for greater customization and is much more aesthetically pleasing, there were times I felt like there were so many steps to take to create a basic chart (like a multiline chart). However, the example charts we went through in class were extremely critical in helping me grasp the fundamental components of every SVG, coupled with the official documentation and additional resources provided by Professor France and Sandy, thereby facilitating the building of more complex charts.</p>
