## Data Sources for Final Project
For my final project, I hope to track the changes in utilisation and delivery of telehealth services before and through COVID-19, highlighting how despite the fact that telemedicine is here to stay as a robust option for care, there remains numerous barriers that reduce accessibility to it. However, this project will likely focus on the broadband, digital literacy and infrastructural barriers to be overcome in the state of Illinois and the city of Chicago. Personally, digital health has always been an area of interest for me as I see it as a great opportunity to reimagine how healthcare services are delivered today. Yet, existing barriers on a community level - many of which are tied to racial and socioeconomic inequities of everyday life - should not be overlooked because it is only when these challenges are acknowledged and addressed, telemedicine can truly be accessible to all.

I will be using several data sources including Medicare/Medicaid Telehealth trends, broadband equity, data literacy rates and socio-economic hardship index.

1. Medicare Telehealth Trends, Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, State-level, https://data.cms.gov/summary-statistics-on-use-and-payments/medicare-service-type-reports/medicare-telehealth-trends
- medicare_telehealth_trends_20220906.csv: The Medicare Telehealth Trends dataset provides information about people with Medicare who used telehealth services between January 1, 2020 and March 31, 2022.
- Primary data source

2. Chicago Broadband Equity, City of Chicago Broadband Equity Project, https://github.com/chicago-cdac/broadbandequity/tree/main/data
- chicago_internet_equity.csv: Total populations, number of households, broadband access, and socioeconomic demographics by Chicago community area (2015-2019)
- Secondary data source

3. Chicago Community Area Hardship Index 2016-2020, University of Illinois Chicago Great Cities Institute, https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/da5601c3e0924e5ab3ee07ade9954f7a
- chicago_hardship_index_2016-2020.csv: Hardship scores by Chicago community area (2016-2020)
- The economic hardship score is the average of six variables from the U.S. Census Bureauâ€™s American Community Survey (ACS) that have been standardized on a scale from 0 to 100. The six variables include: Unemployment (over the age of 16 years), Education (over 25 years of age without a high school diploma), Per capita income level, Poverty (households below the poverty level), Crowded housing (housing units with more than one person per room), Dependency (population under 18 or over 64 years of age).
- Secondary data source

One concern I had was that the data sources I have found are measured at different geographical units - federal-level, state-level, community areas in Chicago. However, I intend to use these data sources to shape different sections of my narrative (e.g. Federal-level or state-level trends might be sufficient to illustrate the drastic increase in telemedicine utilisation rates since the start of COVID-19, but when focusing on the existing digital divide and internet equity issues in Chicago, community-level data would be essential), so there would not be a point where I would need to aggregate these data points into one dataset for visualization.
