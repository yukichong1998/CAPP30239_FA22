    <h1>Police Shootings in 2015</h1>
    <p> In 2015, over 1,500 people were shot and killed by police officers in the US. This page visualizes the 2015 police shooting data from the Washington Post from three main attributes: 
        <ol>
            <li>Race</li>
            <li>Flee Status</li>
            <li>Age</li>
        </ol> 
    </p>
    Data Source: Washington Post
  </div>
  
  <div class="container">
    <h2>By Race</h2>
    <p>This bar chart shows the distribution of people shot by the police by race in 2015.</p>
    <div id="race-chart" class="bar"></div>
    <p>A bar chart was used because the data by race consists of several clear categories and a bar chart would most easily allow for direct comparison of absolute number of people shot across the different races. From this chart, we see that the highest number of people shot by the police was by far White, followed by Black, which is on first glance surprising given the media attention on the disproportionately high number of cases of police brutality on the Black community. However, since this is the absolute number of fatal police shootings, it would be helpful to have data on the total number of shootings to compare the mortality rate of these shootings by race. To dive deeper, it would be interesting to obtain data on the race of the police who fired each shot as that might provide greater insight into the racial bias behind the police shootings.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="container">
    <h2>By Flee Status</h2>
    <p>This ring chart shows the proportion of people shot by the police who tried to flee. Note the gaps in between each arc for ease of distinguishing shapes and the area the shape contains.</p>
    <div id="flee-chart" class="ring"></div>
    <p>A ring chart was used because this data only has two main categories "Flee" and "Did Not Flee", thus the main objective is to compare the values to the entirety or to highlight the disparity in proportions between the two categories, not to focus on the precise values. From this chart, it is evident that an overwhelming majority of people shot by the police did not try to flee, thus this calls to question the legitimacy of the shots fired and if there were other signs that indicated to the police that the person was a threat, since it is only legally justified for officers use lethal force to stop a fleeing felon if they have reasonable grounds to think the suspect is a danger to police or bystanders. </p>
  </div>

  <div class="container">
    <h2>By Age</h2>
    <p>This histogram chart shows the distribution of the age of the people who were shot by the police in 2015.</p>
    <div id="age-chart" class="histogram"></div>
    <p>A histogram chart was used because it is the appropriate chart type to visualize the distribution or relative frequencies of a numerical data point like age. In this case, this chart is useful in representing the relative proportions of people shot across the different age groups. Based on the chart, it is evident that people between ages 20 and 40 form the majority of those shot by the police and this is in line with the shocking claim by researchers and news reports that police use of force is among the leading causes of death for young men of color - a multivariable visualization, including age, race and gender, would be helpful in exploring this claim.</p>
