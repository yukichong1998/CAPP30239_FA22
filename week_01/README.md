Hi there! My name is Yuki and I am a second-year MSCAPP student from Singapore. My policy interests lie at the intersection of urban health, sustainability and tech. In my free time, I love exploring new neighborhoods and cuisines (especially keen on expanding my hotpot options) in Chicago with my friends, but more often than not, I can be found at the corner of a cozy cafe debugging my code.
